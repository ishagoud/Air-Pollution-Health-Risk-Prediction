# Air-Pollution-Health-Risk-Prediction 
 

##  Dataset
- Name:Air Quality and Health Impact Dataset  
- Size: 5811 rows × 15 columns  
- Features:
  - Air Quality Indicators: AQI, PM10, PM2.5, NO2, SO2, O3  
  - Weather Parameters: Temperature, Humidity, WindSpeed  
  - Health Data: RespiratoryCases, CardiovascularCases, HospitalAdmissions  
  - Derived Metrics: HealthImpactScore, HealthImpactClass  

 Observations: 
   - No missing values found.  
   - AQI ranges from ~0 to 500, with mean ~248 (indicating poor air quality).  
   - Higher PM2.5/PM10 levels show possible correlation with increased health cases.  
   - HealthImpactClass ranges 0–4, which can be used as a target label for prediction.
